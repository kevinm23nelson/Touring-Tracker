***Travel Tracker***

Project Overview:

Travel Tracker is an application designed to help users track their travel plans, including past, upcoming, and pending trips. It allows users to book new trips, calculate costs, and view detailed information about their travels.

Setup & Installation:

To view and use the application, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

```git clone git@github.com:kevinm23nelson/touring-tracker.git```

Navigate to the project directory:

```cd travel-tracker```
Install npm dependencies:


```npm install```

Install Webpack:

```npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev```

Start the development server:

```npm start```

Open localhost:8080 in your browser to view the application.

Running Tests
To view the test suite, run:

```npm test```

Skills Utilized:

-OOP using ES6 classes: Organized the codebase with Object-Oriented Programming principles.

-Array Iterator Methods: Leveraged methods like .map, .filter, and .reduce for data manipulation.

-Test Driven Development: Designed the application by writing tests before implementing functionality.

-Accessibility: Followed ARIA guidelines and chose a color scheme accommodating for colorblindness.

-Project Workflow: Used a project board, branches, commits, PRs, and code reviews for efficient workflow.

-Planning & Refactoring: Planned the project with wireframes and refactored code for better structure.
