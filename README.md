About The Project
This project is part of Turing Software and Designs' Front-End Program, Module 2. The project focuses on creating an application to manage and track different trips for users and a travel agency. The program is implemented with ES6 syntax and exclusively uses array-prototype methods whenever iterations need to be performed. There are no for loops used in the program. A Webpack starter-kit was provided, but all code and tests are written by the assigned developer. This program uses Object Oriented Programming to drive the design of the application and the code. This program focuses on working with an API to send and receive data (via fetch functions), the use of Sass alongside traditional css, and Mocha and Chai for testing class functions.
